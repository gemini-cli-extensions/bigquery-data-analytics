## Why Use the BigQuery Data Analytics Extension?

* **Natural Language to data analytics :** Find required BigQuery tables and ask analytical questions in natural language.
* **Seamless Workflow:** Stay in your CLI. No need to constantly switch contexts to the GCP console for generating analytical insights.
* **Run advanced analytics :** Generate forecasts, run a contributions analysis using built-in advanced tools.

* [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed with version **+v0.6.0**.
* Setup Gemini CLI [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-authentication-options).
* A Google Cloud project with the **BigQuery API** enabled.
* Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
* IAM Permissions:
    * BigQuery User (`roles/bigquery.user`)
